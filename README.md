# Miscellaneous Projects for RC2014 Computers

This project contains various bits and bobs I've created or collected relevant to users of RC2014 computers.

Currently the only thing here is an initial project to implement the SC114 bitbang interface for use with CP/M (currently only for systems with ACIA-based serial ports). You'll find this under the sc114 directory.
